## Instructor: [Annapurna Agrawal][instructor url]


The Intent is one of the fundamental building blocks of an Android app. If you want to become a pro Android coder, you're going to need to master Intents. 

In this course, you'll learn everything you need to know to use Intents in your Kotlin Android app. You'll start with learning how Intents help different components of Android to work together. You'll learn how to call activities within the same app and how to use activities from outside the app. You will also see how to accept data from other apps using Intent filters. 

Finally, you'll learn an effective way to test your implementation of implicit intents and custom actions using the Android Debug Bridge (ADB). ADB makes testing very easy and saves a lot of time.
